#### By **{KERNAEL APUKO}**
## Description
{THE TRIANGLE TRACKER IS A WEBPAGE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO INPUT THE LENGTH OF THE SIDES OF A TRIANGLE, AND RETURNS WHETHER THESE SIDES FORM AN EQUILATERAL, ISOSCELES OR SCALENE TRIANGLE OR IF THE SIDES CAN NOT MAKE A TRIANGLE AT ALL. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BROWSER, I RECOMMEND  GOOGLE CHROME INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE
* RUN THE LINK BELOW AND FIND OUT THE TYPE OF YOUR TRIANGLE
*https://github.com/Kernael92/triangle/tree/gh-pages
## Behavior Driven Development
* If all sides of the triangle are equal; for example 4,4,4 ; my output is EQUILATERAL
* If only two sides of the triangle are equal; 4,4,6; my output is ISOSCELES
* If none of the sides of the triangle is equal to the other; 4,5,6 ; my output is SCALENE

## Known Bugs

## Technologies Used
